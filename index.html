      <p>I was born in Kansas City, Missouri, on July 31st, 1977. I
        graduated from North Kansas City High School in
        1995, and attended Southwest Missouri State University on a full debate schloarship. 
        I was more interested in making money than debating, so I left school to pursue a career as a restaurant
        manager. There I met my wife, had a son, went back to school, and found my way to selling spices. 
        I enjoy relaxing on the weekends, traveling with my family to watch my son play baseball, drinking beers, smoking cigars,
        and generally appreciating all of the wonderful things that I have been given in this life. Through that appreciation, 
        I realized that I needed to reevaluate the goals I had for myself and my family.</p>

    <p> I have decided that the only way for me to achieve the goals that I have for myself is to get into a field
        that has infinite possibilties. So here I am ready to code and ready to start the next chapter.
        I am very excited about the world of web development and all the opportunities that I know that it will
        afford. I know that I have a lot to learn, but I know that when you put your mind to something, only the sky is the limit.</p>
